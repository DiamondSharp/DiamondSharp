- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DiamondSharp
- I am looking for someone who can develop/write some software that would allow a commercial coffee machine to generate a unique QR code that's displayed on the machine's screen during/after  each drink has been dispensed? (It's so that a customer can scan the QR code with their smart phone for a loyalty app)
